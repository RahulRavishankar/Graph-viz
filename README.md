## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

> This project's purpose is to visualize different path finding algorithms and understand the nuances and working of popular path finding algorithms like Djikstra, A*, greedy best first search etc.

> The user interface involves a grid where each square cell can be visualized as a graph node.

> The start and end points are marked in red and green respectively. User has the option of shifting the start and end points according to his liking by dragging them across the grid.

> The user can create walls by dragging the mouse on empty cells which will then turn black. The visualizer will find a path wherein these black cells act as obstacles.

> Select the algorithm to be visualized using the "Algorithms" dropdown on the nav bar. The selected algorithm's name will be displayed.

> Click on "Start" button on the navbar to run the algorithm.

> The visualization will start with the visited nodes turning yellow which will showcase how a particular algorithm searches for a path. 

> This will be followed by the visualization of the final path in blue.

> User can use "clear" button to clear grid and reset the algorithm.
